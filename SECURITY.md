# Security Policy

## Project Versions:
- Older versions that are no longer supported may still have known vulnerabilities. We recommend always using the latest supported version to ensure your bot is secure.
- If you have forked this project and use a majority of our code, we strongly advise keeping your fork updated to prevent bugs, exploits, and vulnerabilities from being abused. Updating also ensures you receive the latest features and improvements.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our Discord bot project seriously. If you discover a security issue, please report it responsibly by following these steps.

### How to Report:
1. **Contact Us Privately**:
   - Email: [AetherXdevs@outlook.com](mailto:AetherXdevs@outlook.com)
   - Subject Line: `[Security Issue] [Bot Name]`
   - Include a clear description of the issue, steps to reproduce it, the potential impact, and the affected versions. You may also include a video if you desire to do so.

2. **What Happens Next**:
   - **Acknowledgment**: You will receive an acknowledgment within 24-72 hours of your report.
   - **Assessment**: The issue will be reviewed and verified by our team.
   - **Resolution Timeline**: Critical vulnerabilities will be prioritized, and a patch will be prepared as soon as possible.
   - **Updates**: We will provide regular updates (at least every 7 days) on the status of your report.

3. **After the Fix**:
   - Once resolved, a patched version will be released.
   - If you consent, we will credit your contribution in our public release notes.

### Guidelines for Reporting:
- **Token Security**: If you find exposed bot tokens, API keys, or other sensitive credentials in the source code, please notify us immediately. These issues will be treated with the highest priority.
- **Permissions**: If you discover that the bot requests excessive permissions or uses privileges that could be misused, let us know.
- **Responsible Disclosure**: Avoid sharing details of the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been implemented.

## Responsible Disclosure Policy

We ask that you follow responsible disclosure practices:
- Do not exploit the vulnerability.
- Do not share the vulnerability publicly until a fix has been released.
- We will work with you to address the issue as quickly as possible.

By working together, we can ensure a safer experience for all users of the bot.

This policy applies to all instances of the bot running our publicly available source code. If you run a version of the bot yourself, ensure you follow best practices to secure your token and dependencies.
