## ⚙ Setup

In other/allowed.txt change the settings accordingly, makesure that you use the correct stuff or it will default to normal varibles: `Hex: Default`    `Ansi: White`    `Owner: No`

In .env put the tokens in the respectful location.

In config.json put the tokens in the respectful location.

In bot.js on line `42` change the channel id so it posts to the correct channel.

## 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Contributing

When you want to contribute, fork the repo and DO NOT change the .gitignore, we will change it manually. Just put the note `.gitignore file` to the top of the file and we will do the rest!
